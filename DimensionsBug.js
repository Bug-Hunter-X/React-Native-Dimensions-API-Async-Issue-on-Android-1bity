This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of `Dimensions.get('window')` and `Dimensions.get('screen')`. If you try to access the dimensions immediately after calling `Dimensions.get`, the values might not be fully populated yet, leading to unexpected results or crashes.  This often manifests as incorrect layout calculations, elements not rendering in the expected place, or even app crashes. 

```javascript
// Incorrect Usage
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log(width, height); // May return 0 or incorrect values
```
